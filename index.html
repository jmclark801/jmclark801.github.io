                I am a highly motivated life-long learner that has developed exceptional agile skills by serving in every role on an agile development team. I have a positive, team-oriented attitude that helps build stronger teams and the ability to communicate well with both technologists and business leaders to meet organizational goals. Over the course of my career I have demonstrated both stability and adaptability by constantly learning new skills and taking on new challenges. My most recent challenge currently in progress is the coding bootcamp at the University of Denver.
